# Extended Features

Inspired by the original author of LCC, the textbook, and the teacher I took this course with, I decided to make some extra modules. One is the disassembler, which takes machine code and converts it back into assembly code. The other is a linker steps printer, which prints out the steps the linker takes to combine object files into an executable.
