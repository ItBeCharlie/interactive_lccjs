### **Demo Programs**

1. **Character Cycling Program**
   
   - **Description:** Cycles through characters `'a'` to `'f'`, printing each character to the terminal with a one-second interval.
   - **Highlights:** Demonstrates basic looping, character manipulation, timed pauses, and terminal I/O operations.

2. **Typewriter-Style Printing Program**
   
   - **Description:** Prints the letters `'a'` through `'f'` sequentially in a typewriter-like fashion, adding a one-second delay between each character.
   - **Highlights:** Showcases controlled output sequencing and timed delays to create a smooth, readable display effect.

3. **Key Press Capture Program**
   
   - **Description:** Prompts the user to press any key and continuously displays the pressed key until the Enter key is pressed, upon which the program terminates.
   - **Highlights:** Illustrates user input handling, non-blocking input polling, conditional branching based on input, and string manipulation.

4. **Deterministic Random Number Generator**
   
   - **Description:** Generates and prints 20 deterministic random numbers between 1 and 20 using a fixed seed, ensuring the same sequence of numbers on each run.
   - **Highlights:** Demonstrates random number generation with a fixed seed for reproducibility, loop control, and numerical output formatting.

5. **Non-Deterministic Random Number Generator**
   
   - **Description:** Generates and prints 20 non-deterministic random numbers between 1 and 20 by seeding the random number generator with the current time, resulting in different sequences on each execution.
   - **Highlights:** Showcases dynamic random number generation, use of system time for seeding, and real-time variability in program output.

6. **1D Player Movement Program**
   
   - **Description:** Allows a player to move left and right along a one-dimensional board row. Optimizes rendering by only updating the display when the player moves and resetting the cursor position instead of clearing the entire screen.
   - **Highlights:** Demonstrates efficient rendering techniques, real-time player movement, cursor manipulation, and minimal screen refresh to enhance performance.

7. **Non-Blocking Input Character Movement Program**
   
   - **Description:** Enables a character to move around a board using the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys for movement and `Q` to quit. Utilizes non-blocking input to allow real-time interaction without halting program execution.
   - **Highlights:** Illustrates non-blocking input handling, real-time user interaction, conditional movement based on key presses, and continuous screen updating for an interactive experience.

8. **"Find the Fruit" Game (Precursor to Snake)**
   
   - **Description:** A simple game where the player moves around a board to eat randomly placed fruit. Each time the player collides with the fruit, it is repositioned randomly on the board.
   - **Highlights:** Demonstrates basic game mechanics including player movement, collision detection, random placement of objects, and real-time rendering updates.

9. **Work-in-Progress Snake Game**
   
   - **Description:** An assembly-based implementation of the classic Snake game. Features include player movement, fruit placement, snake growth, and initial groundwork for snake body rendering and collision detection.
   - **Highlights:** Showcases advanced game logic, dynamic data structures for the snake's body, real-time input handling, collision mechanics, and iterative development with planned feature enhancements.
