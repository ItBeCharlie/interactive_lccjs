# **Onboarding Strategy**

1. **Engaging Introduction**: Begin by explaining the **purpose and significance** of the project in simple terms.

2. **High-Level Overview**: Provide a clear **architectural overview** of how the components interact.

3. **Deep Dive into Components**:
   - **lcc.js**: Explain its role as the orchestrator.
   - **assembler.js**: Describe how it translates assembly code to machine code.
   - **interpreter.js**: Discuss how it executes the machine code.

4. **Build and Execution Process**: Walk through the typical workflow of writing, assembling, and running a program.

5. **Areas for Improvement**: Highlight the project's current limitations and areas where contributions are welcome.

6. **Hands-On Experience**: Encourage them to run example programs and explore the code.

7. **Resources and Documentation**: Point them to the improved README and any additional resources.
