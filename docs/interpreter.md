**Interpreter.js Overview**

`interpreter.js` is a Node.js-based interpreter designed to execute machine code produced by `assembler.js` within the LCC.js ecosystem. It emulates a 16-bit machine architecture, handling memory operations, register management, instruction execution, and input/output (I/O) interactions. Additionally, it offers features for debugging and generating execution statistics to aid developers in testing and optimizing their assembly programs.

### **Functionality**

1. **Executable File Handling:**
   - **Input Format:** Primarily processes `.e` (executable) files generated by `assembler.js`.
   - **Validation:** Ensures the input file adheres to the expected format by checking for specific signatures (`'o'` and `'C'`).
   - **Memory Loading:** Parses the executable's header to initialize the start address and load machine code into simulated memory at a specified load point.

2. **Machine Architecture Simulation:**
   - **Memory:** Utilizes a `Uint16Array` to represent 65,536 memory addresses (16-bit each).
   - **Registers:** Emulates eight 16-bit registers (`r0` to `r7`), including special-purpose registers like the Program Counter (`pc`) and Instruction Register (`ir`).
   - **Flags:** Manages condition flags (`Negative` - `n`, `Zero` - `z`, `Carry` - `c`, `Overflow` - `v`) that influence program flow based on operation outcomes.

3. **Instruction Execution:**
   - **Decoding and Execution:** Fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes corresponding operations such as arithmetic (`ADD`, `SUB`), logical (`AND`, `NOT`), branching (`BR`), memory operations (`LD`, `ST`), and trap routines (`TRAP`).
   - **Flag Updates:** Adjusts condition flags based on the results of operations to affect subsequent instructions.

4. **Input/Output Operations:**
   - **Standard Output:** Handles various output formats through trap vectors (`DOUT`, `UDOUT`, `HOUT`, `AOUT`, `SOUT`), allowing the program to display data in decimal, hexadecimal, ASCII characters, and strings.
   - **Standard Input:** Manages user inputs required by trap routines (`SIN`, `DIN`, `HIN`, etc.), supporting both simulated inputs (useful for automated testing) and real-time user interactions.

5. **Execution Control and Safety:**
   - **Execution Loop:** Continuously executes instructions until a halt condition is met or an error occurs.
   - **Instruction Cap:** Implements a limit (`instructionsCap`) to prevent infinite loops, ensuring the interpreter remains responsive.
   - **Error Handling:** Provides descriptive error messages for issues like invalid instructions, memory access violations, and division by zero, halting execution as necessary.

6. **Debugging and Statistics:**
   - **Listing and Statistics Files:** Generates `.lst` (listing) and `.bst` (binary statistics) files that detail execution flow, memory usage, and instruction counts.
   - **Stack Management Tracking:** Monitors stack operations to report on stack size and detect potential overflows or underflows.

### **Purpose**

The primary purpose of `interpreter.js` is to provide a runtime environment for assembly programs developed using LCC.js. By emulating a 16-bit machine architecture, it allows developers to execute, test, and debug their assembly code efficiently. The interpreter facilitates accurate simulation of program behavior, ensuring that assembly instructions perform as intended and aiding in the identification and resolution of bugs through comprehensive error reporting and execution statistics.

### **Major Components**

1. **Class: `Interpreter`**
   
   - **Properties:**
     - `mem`: Simulated memory space (`Uint16Array`).
     - `r`: Array of eight 16-bit registers (`r0` to `r7`).
     - `pc`: Program Counter tracking the next instruction.
     - `ir`: Instruction Register holding the current instruction.
     - `n`, `z`, `c`, `v`: Condition flags influencing program flow.
     - `running`: Boolean flag indicating active execution.
     - `output`: Buffer accumulating output data.
     - `inputBuffer`: Buffer for handling user inputs.
     - `instructionsExecuted`: Counter for executed instructions.
     - `maxStackSize`: Tracks maximum stack usage.
     - `loadPoint`: Memory address where the program is loaded.
     - `memMax`: Highest memory address utilized.
     - `inputFileName`: Name of the input executable file.
     - `generateStats`: Flag to determine if statistics files are generated.
     - `headerLines`: Stores metadata from the executable's header.
     - `instructionsCap`: Limit to prevent infinite loops.

   - **Key Methods:**
     - `main(args)`: Parses command-line arguments, validates and loads the executable, and starts execution.
     - `loadExecutableFile(fileName)`: Validates and loads the executable file into memory.
     - `loadExecutableBuffer(buffer)`: Processes the executable's binary data, extracting header information and loading machine code.
     - `run()`: Initiates the execution loop, continuously processing instructions.
     - `step()`: Executes a single instruction cycle, including fetching, decoding, and executing.
     - **Instruction Execution Methods:** (`executeADD()`, `executeSUB()`, `executeBR()`, etc.) Handle specific instruction logic.
     - **I/O Methods:** (`readLineFromStdin()`, `readCharFromStdin()`, `writeOutput(message)`) Manage user interactions and output generation.
     - **Flag Management Methods:** (`setNZ(value)`, `setCV(sum, x, y)`, `signExtend(value, bitWidth)`, `toSigned16(value)`) Update condition flags based on operations.
     - `error(message)`: Logs errors and halts execution.

2. **Utility Modules:**
   
   - **`../utils/genStats.js`:**
     - **Function:** `generateBSTLSTContent`
     - **Purpose:** Creates content for `.lst` and `.bst` files, detailing execution flow, memory usage, and performance metrics.
   
   - **`../utils/name.js`:**
     - **Function:** `nameHandler.createNameFile`
     - **Purpose:** Manages naming conventions for generated files, ensuring consistency between input and output filenames.

### **Key Features**

- **Comprehensive Instruction Support:** Handles a wide range of assembly instructions, enabling versatile program functionalities.
- **Robust Memory and Register Management:** Accurately simulates a 16-bit address space and eight general-purpose registers, ensuring realistic program behavior.
- **Detailed Error Reporting:** Provides clear and contextual error messages to aid in debugging and program verification.
- **Execution Safeguards:** Implements instruction caps and validates operations to maintain interpreter stability and prevent infinite loops.
- **Debugging Assistance:** Generates listing and statistics files that offer insights into program execution, facilitating optimization and troubleshooting.

### **Usage**

To execute a program using `interpreter.js`, run the script via Node.js with the appropriate input executable file and optional parameters:

```bash
node interpreter.js <input_filename> [options]
```

- **Required Argument:**
  - `<input_filename>`: Path to the `.e` (executable) file to be interpreted.

- **Supported Options:**
  - `-nostats`: Disables the generation of `.lst` and `.bst` listing and statistics files.
  - `-L<load_point>` or `-L <load_point>`: Specifies the memory address where the program should be loaded (in hexadecimal).

**Example:**

```bash
node interpreter.js program.e -L0x3000
```

This command interprets `program.e`, loading it into memory starting at address `0x3000`, and generates corresponding `.lst` and `.bst` files unless the `-nostats` option is specified.
