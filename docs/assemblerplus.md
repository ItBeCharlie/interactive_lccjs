**LCC+js Assembly: Additions, Core Features, and What They Enable**

The **LCC.js** assembler (`assembler.js`) provides a traditional two-pass assembly process for a 16-bit architecture, handling standard directives (`.start`, `.globl`, `.extern`, `.word`, etc.) and mnemonics (e.g., `add`, `sub`, `ld`, `st`, `mov`). It produces `.e` or `.o` files suitable for execution or linking within the LCC.js ecosystem.

**LCC+js** takes this foundation further by introducing a specialized assembler (`assemblerplus.js`) and new assembly constructs geared toward real-time, interactive applications—particularly games. Below is an overview of the added features, how they differ from plain LCC.js assembly, and what possibilities they unlock.

## 1. Extended Directives and File Handling

1. **`.ap` File Extension:**
   - LCC+js assembly is stored in **`.ap`** files (as opposed to `.a` in LCC.js).
   - `assemblerplus.js` specifically requires `.ap` files, rejecting other extensions.

2. **`.lccplus` Directive:**
   - Signals that the source code uses LCC+js features.
   - Ensures a special header entry (`p`) is included in the output, indicating the file is an LCC+js program rather than a standard LCC.js program.
   - If `.lccplus` is missing, `assemblerplus.js` refuses to produce final output.

## 2. New Instructions for Real-Time and Game-Oriented Features

LCC+js introduces custom instructions that integrate with the underlying runtime to offer enhanced functionality, including:

1. **`clear`:** Clears the terminal screen without halting program flow.  
2. **`sleep rX`:** Pauses execution for the duration (in milliseconds) stored in register `rX`.  
3. **`nbain rX`:** Non-blocking input—reads a character into `rX` if available, or sets `rX` to 0 if no input is pending.  
4. **`cursor rX`:** Toggles or manipulates the terminal cursor based on the value in `rX` (e.g., hide cursor by setting `rX` = 0).  
5. **`srand rX`:** Seeds the random number generator with the value in `rX`, enabling randomized game logic.  
6. **`rand rD, rS`:** Stores a random number in register `rD`, using `rS` to define upper bounds or ranges.  
7. **`millis rX`:** Retrieves the current time in milliseconds into `rX` (useful for seeding randomness or real-time measurement).  
8. **`resetc`:** Resets the cursor to the top-left corner without clearing the entire screen, enabling efficient redraws.

These instructions are encoded as specialized **trap vectors** that route through the runtime’s built-in functions. They let assembly programmers implement features like:

- **Real-Time Delays:** Use `sleep` to schedule timed events or create game loops.
- **Non-Blocking Input:** Use `nbain` to continuously poll for keyboard input without stopping the game or program.
- **Screen Clearing & Cursor Control:** Efficiently update game displays and minimize flicker.
- **Random Number Generation:** Create deterministic (seed-based) or non-deterministic game behaviors (via `millis` + `srand` + `rand`).
- **Partial Screen Refresh:** Use `resetc` to redraw portions of the display, improving performance for game-like graphics.

## 3. Output Format and Header Changes

- **`.ep` Output Files:**  
  Instead of generating `.e` files, the **assemblerplus.js** produces **`.ep`** (LCC+js executable) files containing the extra `p` header entry.  
- **`p` Header Entry:**  
  Inserted if `.lccplus` is detected, allowing interpreters or linkers to identify and handle LCC+js programs with extended instructions.

## 4. Enabling Real-Time and Interactive Assembly Programs

With these **LCC+js** additions, developers can create:

1. **Real-Time Interactive Games:**  
   - Non-blocking input for movement (`nbain`), real-time screen updates (`resetc`, `clear`), and random events (`rand`, `srand`, `millis`).  
   - Smooth user experience without pausing the entire program loop for input.

2. **Animated Graphics and Timed Sequences:**  
   - `sleep` allows straightforward, millisecond-precision timing to animate sprites, cycle characters, or schedule events.

3. **Cursor and Screen Management:**  
   - Hide cursor to prevent flicker, print partial updates for performance, or place the cursor at the top-left for continuous refreshing.

These capabilities are showcased in the **plus demos** programs, which highlight:

- Character movement and real-time user input.  
- Random placement of objects (fruit, snake segments, etc.).  
- Efficient partial screen redraws rather than full clears.  
- Timed actions, such as printing characters at intervals or sleeping between frames.

## 5. Summary of Differences from Plain LCC.js Assembly

- **File Extension and Directive:** `.ap` sources and the required `.lccplus` directive clearly mark LCC+js code as distinct from `.a` (plain assembly).
- **Instruction Set Expansion:** New real-time and graphical instructions (`clear`, `sleep`, `nbain`, etc.) are absent in plain LCC.js assembly.
- **Output Format:** LCC+js produces `.ep` files with an additional `p` header entry, whereas standard LCC.js outputs `.e` or `.o`.
- **Enhanced Game Engine Capabilities:** Direct, built-in instructions for timing, randomization, and partial rendering allow writing games and interactive applications entirely in assembly.

### **What LCC+js Assembly Enables**

Overall, **LCC+js assembly** transforms the static nature of a typical assembler environment into a **real-time, game-capable platform**. By providing built-in functionality for timing, input, display management, and randomness, LCC+js allows assembly programmers to build:

- **Interactive Terminal-Based Games** (like Snake or a simple “find the fruit” logic).  
- **Real-Time Simulations** using time-based events and polling for user input.  
- **Dynamic Visual Applications** that rely on partial screen updates and smooth transitions.

These features offer a powerful demonstration of how assembly language can be leveraged for real-time applications, moving beyond basic instruction sets to a more modern, feature-rich approach within the LCC.js ecosystem.
